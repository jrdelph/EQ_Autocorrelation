# EQ_Autocorrelation
CODES NOT AVAILABLE YET (8/8/2019)
Hope to have working codes with practice dataset uploaded by 8/11/2019

This project runs the multistep analysis outlined by Delph et al. (2019), which calculates P-wave receiver functions and autocorrelations followed by H-k-Vp Stacking Analysis and Gaussian Mixture Modeling if necessary.
