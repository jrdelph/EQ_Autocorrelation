# EQ_Autocorrelation

These codes run the multistep analysis outlined by Delph et al. (2019). These will calculate autocorrelations and run H-k-Vp Stacking Analysis on autocorrelations and receiver functions. They can also run Gaussian Mixture Modeling , if necessary.

To get the latest version of the codes, go to "Releases" and download the tar file for V1.0.1, or click here: https://github.com/jrdelph/EQ_Autocorrelation/releases/tag/v1.0.1

The tarball contains a User's Manual that describes the code. It also contains data for testing the codes and a completed example run by me for comparison (in RUN_BY_JRD).
